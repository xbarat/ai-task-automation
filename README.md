## agents.json

✅ Discover and integrate APIs autonomously.
✅ Negotiate authentication and permissions without human setup.
✅ Execute multi-step workflows across services (e.g., book a tour, schedule a ride, send a payment).
✅ Handle failures intelligently, escalating when needed (e.g., calling an agent if API booking fails).
