# Problem Statement
API Integration is complex, no standardized framework, no AI-native tooling, 

we have the following problems:

1. API Integration is a manual process and complex at scale
2. API documentation is not standardized and not agent-friendly
3. No standardized framework for agentic API interaction
4. No way to verify if an API can be used for a given task
5. No way to discover and onboard new APIs
6. Non-technical users cannot access or use APIs
7. API usage is silod behind corporate firewalls

# Benchmarks

Yes, there is a benchmark for evaluating autonomous task execution using AI. The most notable one is **TaskBench**, introduced to systematically assess the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in task automation. 

### **About TaskBench**
TaskBench evaluates LLMs across three critical stages of task automation:
1. **Task Decomposition**: Breaking down complex instructions into actionable sub-tasks.
2. **Tool Invocation**: Selecting and utilizing the appropriate external tools or APIs.
3. **Parameter Prediction**: Accurately determining the parameters needed for tool execution.

It uses a **Tool Graph** to represent task dependencies and employs a "back-instruct" method to generate high-quality user instructions. The evaluation framework, called **TaskEval**, combines automated data generation with human validation to ensure reliability and consistency with human judgment[1][3][7].

### **Other Benchmarks**
- **LoTa-Bench**: Focuses on task automation in virtual environments (e.g., AI2-THOR, VirtualHome) to evaluate embodied agents' performance in real-world-like scenarios, such as household tasks[9].

These benchmarks provide standardized ways to measure LLM performance in task automation, enabling fair comparisons and driving advancements in this space.
