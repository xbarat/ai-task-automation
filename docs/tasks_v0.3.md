# Sprint 1: Planning & Research Tasks

---

## Task 1: Map the API Discovery Landscape  
**ðŸ§‘ðŸ’¼ Stakeholder Story:**  
"Just like shoppers need a store directory to find products, AI agents need a standardized way to discover APIs. We're researching existing standards to create a familiar but AI-optimized discovery system."

**ðŸ‘©ðŸ’» Technical Description:**  
- Research OpenAPI, robots.txt, and .well-known conventions
- Document 3 API discovery patterns with pros/cons
- Identify gaps for AI-native requirements

**âœ… Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Comparison matrix of 5+ discovery mechanisms
- [ ] Documented 3 best practices for AI-parsable formats
- [ ] List of required extensions for AI agent needs

**ðŸ“Š Metrics:**  
1. 100% coverage of major discovery standards
2. 3 concrete examples of API metadata implementations
3. Clear gap analysis report

## Task 2: Select Real-World API Testbed  
**ðŸ§‘ðŸ’¼ Stakeholder Story:**  
"We need to choose a 'training ground' for our AI agent - a real API that represents common challenges our users will face, like a chef selecting quality ingredients for a new recipe."

**ðŸ‘©ðŸ’» Technical Description:**  
- Evaluate 3 real estate APIs (Zillow, StreetEasy, Realtor.com)
- Create evaluation matrix: authentication, rate limits, docs quality
- Select primary test API + backup

**âœ… Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] API comparison matrix with 5+ evaluation criteria
- [ ] Chosen API with >=80% required features coverage
- [ ] Access to test credentials/sandbox

**ðŸ“Š Metrics:**  
1. 3 APIs evaluated within 2 business days
2. Selection rationale document approved
3. Test environment access confirmed

---

## Task 3: Define Core Schema Requirements  
**ðŸ§‘ðŸ’¼ Stakeholder Story:**  
"Creating the API 'dictionary' that both humans and AIs can understand - like designing a universal recipe format that works for both chefs and cooking robots."

**ðŸ‘©ðŸ’» Technical Description:**  
- Draft initial JSON schema with required fields:
  ```json
  {
    "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
    "type": "object",
    "required": ["api", "auth", "endpoints"],
    "properties": {
      "api": {/*...*/},
      "auth": {/*...*/},
      "endpoints": {/*...*/}
    }
  }
  ```
- Validate with JSON Schema Validator
- Document field requirements and constraints

**âœ… Acceptance Criteria:**  
- [ ] Schema draft covering discovery+auth basics
- [ ] Validation rules for required fields
- [ ] 100% test coverage for schema validation

**ðŸ“Š Metrics:**  
1. Schema supports 2+ auth methods (OAuth2, API Key)
2. 10+ validation test cases
3. Documentation reviewed by 2+ team members
